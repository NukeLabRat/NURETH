  abstract     = {Experimental and numerical studies have been carried out on the combined phenomena of molecular diffusion and natural convection with a graphite oxidation reaction in a multicomponent gas system to investigate the process of air ingress into a reverse U-shaped tube consisting of one side heated and the other side cooled pipes. The range of the Grashof number based on the height of the tube was about $3.7\times10^9 < Gr_L 4.7\times10^11$. One-dimensional basic equations for continuity, momentum conservation, energy conservation of the gas mixture, and mass conservation of the gas species are numerically solved to obtain concentration changes in the gas species and the onset time of the natural circulation of air. The experimental results showed that air entered the tube due to molecular diffusion and a very weak natural convection of the multicomponent gas mixed prior to the onset of the natural circulation of air. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental ones regarding the concentration changes in the gas species and the onset time of the natural circulation of air.},

Phenomena identification and ranking studies to date have ranked an air-ingress event, following on the heels of a VHTR depressurization, as important with regard to core safety. Consequently, the development of advanced air-ingress-related models and verification and validation data are a very high priority. Following a loss of coolant and system depressurization incident, air will enter the core of the VHTR through the break, possibly causing oxidation of the graphite core and reflector graphite structure. Simple core and plant models indicate that, under certain circumstances, the oxidation may proceed at an elevated rate with additional heat generated from the oxidation reaction itself. Under postulated conditions of fluid flow and temperature, excessive degradation of lower plenum graphite caused by graphite oxidation can lead to a loss of mechanical strength. Excessive oxidation of core graphite can also lead to a release of fission products into the confinement, which could be detrimental to reactor safety. Analytical models developed in this study will improve our understanding of this phenomenon. This paper presents two sets of analytical models for the qualitative assessment of the air-ingress phenomena. The results from the analytical models are compared with results of the computational fluid dynamic models (CFD) in the subsequent paper. The analytical models agree well with those CFD results. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Computational fluid dynamics models developed in this study will improve our understanding of this phenomenon and is used to mitigate air ingress. This paper presents three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) results for the quantitative assessment of the air-ingress phenomena. The 3D CFD simulation results show that the air-ingress accident is not controlled by molecular diffusion but density gradient driven stratified flow when the double-ended-guillotine break is assumed in a horizontal pipe configuration. It concludes that the previous air-ingress scenarios based on the molecular diffusion might not be correct and should be extensively modified to include real phenomena. This paper also presents a preliminary two-dimensional (2D) CFD simulation for validating an air-ingress mitigation concept using helium injection at the lower plenum. This simulation shows that the helium replaces air by buoyancy force and effectively mitigates air-ingress into the core.},

  abstract     = {The nuclear heat utilization systems connected to high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) will be designed on the basis of non-nuclear-grade standards in terms of easier entry for the chemical plant companies and the construction economics of the systems. Therefore, it is necessary that the reactor operations can be continued even if abnormal events occur in the systems. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency has developed a calculation code to evaluate the absorption of thermal-load fluctuations by the reactors when the reactor operations are continued after such events, and has improved the code based on the high-temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR) operating data. However, there were insufficient data on the transient temperature behavior of the metallic components and the graphite core support structures corresponding to the fluctuation of the reactor inlet coolant temperature for further improvement of the code. Thus, nuclear heat supply fluctuation tests with the HTTR were carried out in non-nuclear heating operation to focus on the thermal effect. In the tests, the coolant helium gas temperature was heated to 120°C by the compression heat of the gas circulators in the HTTR, and a sufficiently large fluctuation of 17°C for the reactor inlet coolant was achieved by devising a new test procedure under the ideal condition without the effect of the nuclear power. Then, the temperature responses of the metallic components and the graphite core support structures were investigated. The test results adequately showed as predicted that the temperature responses of the metallic components are faster than those of the graphite blocks, and the mechanism of the thermal-load fluctuation absorption by the metallic components was clarified.},

As the first step of our final goal of predicting the multicomponent gas flow in a reactor during the early stages of the accident, the present paper aims at studying experimentally and analytically, the basic features of air ingress and gas transportation by transient molecular diffusion and the transient natural convection of a two-component gas mixture. The present paper comprises two main parts. The first part deals with analytical and experimental studies on N2 ingress (corresponding to air ingress) and gas transportation by molecular diffusion and the one-dimensional natural convection of an He-N2 two-component gas mixture in a reverse-U-shaped tube. Analytical and experimental results are discussed on the N2 mole fraction change with time after the simulated pipe rupture and on the initiation time of the natural circulation of pure N2. The second part deals with a preliminary simulation test of air ingress during the early stages of the accident. The test is performed with a very simple model of the reactor. The experimental results are discussed on the change in mole fraction of air with time and on the initiation time of the natural circulation of pure air. ?? 1991.},

  abstract     = {A critical event in the safety analysis of the very high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR) is an air-ingress accident. This accident is initiated, in its worst case scenario, by a double-ended guillotine break of the coaxial cross vessel, which leads to a rapid reactor vessel depressurization. In a VHTR, the reactor vessel is located within a reactor cavity that is filled with air during normal operating conditions. Following the vessel depressurization, the dominant mode of ingress of an air-helium mixture into the reactor vessel will either be molecular diffusion or density-driven stratified flow. The mode of ingress is hypothesized to depend largely on the break conditions of the cross vessel. Since the time scales of these two ingress phenomena differ by orders of magnitude, it is imperative to understand under which conditions each of these mechanisms will dominate in the air ingress process. Computer models have been developed to analyze this type of accident scenario. There are, however, limited experimental data available to understand the phenomenology of the air-ingress accident and to validate these models. Therefore, there is a need to design and construct a scaled-down experimental test facility to simulate the air-ingress accident scenarios and to collect experimental data. The current paper focuses on the analyses performed for the design and operation of a 1/8th geometric scale (by height and diameter), high-temperature test facility. A geometric scaling analysis for the VHTR, a time scale analysis of the air-ingress phenomenon, a transient depressurization analysis of the reactor vessel, a hydraulic similarity analysis of the test facility, a heat transfer characterization of the hot plenum, a power scaling analysis for the reactor system, and a design analysis of the containment vessel are discussed.},
