  abstract     = {Raman spectroscopy has historically played an important role in the structural characterization of graphitic materials, in particular providing valuable information about defects, stacking of the graphene layers and the finite sizes of the crystallites parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal axis. Here we review the defect-induced Raman spectra of graphitic materials from both experimental and theoretical standpoints and we present recent Raman results on nanographites and graphenes. The disorder-induced D and D' Raman features, as well as the G'-band (the overtone of the D-band which is always observed in defect-free samples), are discussed in terms of the double-resonance (DR) Raman process, involving phonons within the interior of the 1st Brillouin zone of graphite and defects. In this review, experimental results for the D, D' and G' bands obtained with different laser lines, and in samples with different crystallite sizes and different types of defects are presented and discussed. We also present recent advances that made possible the development of Raman scattering as a tool for very accurate structural analysis of nano-graphite, with the establishment of an empirical formula for the in- and out-of-plane crystalline size and even fancier Raman-based information, such as for the atomic structure at graphite edges, and the identification of single versus multi-graphene layers. Once established, this knowledge provides a powerful machinery to understand newer forms of sp(2) carbon materials, such as the recently developed pitch-based graphitic foams. Results for the calculated Raman intensity of the disorder-induced D-band in graphitic materials as a function of both the excitation laser energy (E(laser)) and the in-plane size (L(a)) of nano-graphites are presented and compared with experimental results. The status of this research area is assessed, and opportunities for future work are identified.},

Using Generation-IV candidate graphite samples (grade PCEA, GrafTech), subjected to neutron irradiation at 900 °C to 6.6 and 10.2 dpa, and graphite samples of similar grain size and microstructure taken from the core of the British Experimental Pile Zero reactor, which have been irradiated at 100–120 °C to 1.60 dpa, an investigation is presented on the effect of irradiation dose and temperature on the aforementioned microstructural parameters. Using two complementary techniques in Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which produced agreeable results, the average lateral crystallite size of the two graphites tested was found to decrease with increasing exposure to fast-neutron irradiation or at lower irradiation temperatures. Conversely, dislocation densities and micro-strains were found to increase following the same changes in irradiation conditions. Supporting evidence for the microstructural information obtained is provided by direct observations made using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. These images demonstrate the presence of irradiation-induced prismatic edge dislocations as well as features that indicate the presence of basal dislocations. They also provide supporting evidence for the progressive deterioration of the graphitic planes via damage mechanisms as proposed in the literature.},

Results indicate that IG-110 has a larger crystallite size and higher degree of graphitization, but lower anisotropy than NBG-18. These differences are attributed to the properties of coke source and manufacturing processes. Additionally, the shape of the pores and crystallized filler particles, the interface between binders and fillers, Mrozowski cracks and nano-cracks, and the defects of disclination were observed and characterized from SEM and HR-TEM images. The similarities and differences in microstructure between IG-110 and NBG-18 are discussed.

The finer-grained graphites IG-110 and IG-11 were more oxidized than medium-grained NBG-18 and NBG-17 because of deeper oxidant penetration, higher porosity and higher probability of available active sites. Variation in experimental conditions also had a marked effect on the reported kinetic parameters by several studies. Kinetic parameters such as activation energy and transition temperature were sensitive to air flow rates as well as sample size and geometry.},

  abstract  = {The emissivities of a typical carbon, graphite, and pyrolytic graphite possessing different surfaces were measured over the temperature range of 850° to 1800°C, utilizing an emissivity apparatus based upon a modification of the Fery rotating sample method. Results for graphite show that for a highly polished surface produced by burnishing the spectral emissivity is almost independent of temperature, while the integrated emissivity value shows a positive temperature dependence. After roughening the surface by various treatments, spectral values show a negative temperature coefficient, while integrated values are almost temperature independent. Carbon shows only slight changes in the emissivity with surface variations; a higher emissivity goes with rougher surfaces, but no change is observed in temperature dependence. These results are internally consistent and are interpreted on the basis of the surface treatment influencing the crystal orientation of the graphite surface. The differences in temperature dependence appear to be related to the anisotropic optical properties of graphite. Large optical anisotropy is to be expected in graphite due to the related electrical anisotropy that has been previously observed.},

  abstract     = {The isotropic algorithm is constructed for random close packing of equisized spheres with triply periodic boundary conditions. All previously published packing methods with periodic boundaries were kinetics-determined; i.e., they contained a densification rate as an arbitrary parameter. In contrast, the present algorithm is kinetic-independent and demonstrates an unambiguous convergence to the experimental results. To suppress crystallization, the main principles of our algorithm are (1) to form a contact network at an early stage and (2) retain contacts throughout the densification, as far as possible. The particles are allowed to swell by the numerical solution of the differential equations of densification. The RHS of these equations is calculated efficiently from a linear system by a combination of conjugate gradient iterations and exact sparse matrix technology. When an excessive contact occurs and one of the existing bonds should be broken to continue the densification, an efficient criterion based on multidimensional simplex geometry is used for searching the separating bond. The algorithm has a well-defined termination point resulting in a perfect contact network with the average coordination number six (for particle number N ≫ 1) and a system of normal reactions between the spheres maintaining the structure. These forces are the counterpart of the algorithm and can be used to calculate small elastic particle deformations in a granular medium. Extensive calculations are presented for 50 ≤ N ≤ 400 and demonstrate very good agreement with the experimental packing density (about 0.637) and structure. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is proposed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior in a segment of pebbles representing the central region of a PBR. Two kinds of contact modeling between adjacent pebbles are adopted, namely area and point contact treatments. The former contact treatment is a geometric approximation modeling. Based on the comparisons of thermal-hydraulic characteristics in the pebbles predicted by both contact treatments, no significant difference is revealed except for the near-wall secondary flow pattern. In addition, compared with the calculated results from the well-known correlations, the present predicted dependence of Nu number and friction factor on the particle Reynolds number shows good agreement qualitatively and quantitatively. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The script language PERL is used as a development tool to manipulate and control the entire coupled calculation. This research gives the conclusion that the steady-state coupled calculation using RMC and CFX is feasible and can obtain stable results within a few iterations. However, due to the statistical errors of Monte Carlo method, the fluctuation of results still occurs.

  abstract     = {In a high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), one can postulate simultaneous ruptures of the pressure boundary at points near the top and bottom of the reactor vessel. In this extremely low probability event, depressurization and heat-up of the core can lead to ingress of air into the vessel driven by the buoyancy of the hot helium relative to the colder, cavity air (‘chimney effect'). Although this is considered a ‘beyond design basis accidents' (BDBA), it receives high attention because it may lead to graphite oxidation of reflectors and fuel elements so as to weaken the structural strength and lessen the ability of the coated particles to retain fission products. A study of the rate and severity of the air ingress and potential for oxidation in the 200 MWe Pebble-bed Modular High Temperature gas-cooled Reactor (HTR-PM) is described in this paper. The TINTE code was used to simulate the air ingress accident caused by the simultaneous rupture of the fuel charging tube and fuel discharging tube. A mitigation measure, the injection of nitrogen into the vessel, has also been proposed and evaluated with the TINTE model. The results indicate that, due to the high flow resistance of the pebble-bed core, the air ingress flow rate is limited. The oxygen content in the reactor cavity is also limited due to the design of the Ventilated Low Pressure Containment (VLPC) that prevents the corrosion of the fuel elements and reflectors by limiting the amount of air that can enter the vessel. The results also indicate that the injection of the nitrogen in a suitable location and with a suitable mass flow rate can effectively prevent significant corrosion of the graphite.},

  abstract     = {The analysis and understanding of air ingress events are an important aspect of the design of high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) accident scenarios. These include depressurized loss of forced cooling (D-LOFC) events that allow for the possibility of air ingress into the reactor pressure vessel as a result of a break in the helium pressure boundary, which can ultimately result in oxidation of the fuel elements and other nuclear-grade graphite components. To characterize air ingress into the vented low-pressure containment of the next generation nuclear plant HTGR during hypothetical moderate-sized D-LOFC break accidents experimentally, a 1/28 scaled simplified reactor building model was established. A non-dimensional similarity approach was employed for scaling of the experimental facility. Three experiments were designed and conducted to study the dynamic response to the accident scenario. The experimental results suggest an increment in the flow area of the check valve between the reactor cavity (CV1) and steam generator cavity (CV3). Furthermore, qualitative analysis was conducted on the experimental data.},

  abstract     = {The high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble bed module (HTR-PM) has wide potential applications in the development of advanced nuclear energy. The double-ended guillotine break (DEGB) of the horizontal coaxial gas duct accident is a kind of beyond design basis accident of HTR-PM, which will result in air ingress into the reactor core. Even though the rare probability of this accident, it still has got a lot of concerns in the safety analyses of HTR-PM, due to the possible severe consequences of the air ingress accident, which would cause oxidation of the graphite material in the reactor. The oxidation of matrix graphite of spherical fuel elements may lead to the exposure of the TRISO fuel particles and the increase of the radioactivity release. The oxidation of the bottom reflector may cause the decrease of mechanical strength of the nuclear grade graphite. Different kinds of nuclear graphite of the bottom reflector will influence the consequences of the DEGB of the horizontal coaxial gas duct accident. This paper mainly analyzed the influence of the nuclear grade graphite used as the bottom reflector on the consequences of this accident by using the system analysis TINTE code.},

The model specifically accounts for the porous structure, which is characterised using the radial variation in porosity, coordination number and contact angles between adjacent spheres. It also accounts for solid and gas thermal conduction, contact area, surface roughness as well as the thermal radiation for pebble temperatures up to 1200°C. This more rigorous approach to characterising the porous structure enables improved prediction of the effective thermal conductivity in the near-wall and wall regions, resulting in better prediction of the temperatures at the reflector interface. Results obtained with the Multi-sphere Unit Cell model are compared with existing correlations and experimental data including those from the SANA-I experimental test facility. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.
